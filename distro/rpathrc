# Configuration for rPath registration client
#
# Note: When setting the following configuration parameters, be sure to
# take the following into account:
# 
# o The total number of systems that will be registering with a given
#   rBuilder
#
# o The way in which the rBuilder has been configured to handle the
#   registration and polling of systems
#
# These values can also be overridden at boot time on the kernel command line
# if specified in the form of RPATHTOOLS=OPTION=VALUE.  For example:
# RPATHTOOLS=bootRegister=1
#
# For more details, see the rBuilder Administration Guide.

# Include all config files defined under this directory.  Allows for
# overriding configuration options and setting configuration options from boot
# time parameters.
includeConfigFile /etc/conary/rpath-tools/config.d/*

# *** PARAMETERS CONTROLLING WHEN REGISTRATION SHOULD OCCUR ***
#
# The following parameters define the situations under which the
# registration (and deregistration) process should happen:

# Register at boot -- Attempt to register the system as the system goes
# through its normal startup processing.  Disabling this feature means
# that the system will only register itself if either the registration
# interval or the contact timeout interval is non-zero, or an rBuilder
# administrator has manually entered the system's IP address into
# rBuilder's system inventory.
#
# Minimum value: 0 (disables boot-time registration)
# Maximum value: 1 (enables boot-time registration)
bootRegistration 1

# Deregister at shutdown -- Attempt to deregister the system as the
# system goes through its normal shutdown processing.  Disabling this
# feature means that the rBuilder will only be able to determine that the
# system is no longer accessible as part of its normal "aging out"
# process and, until that process takes place, the system inventory will
# show the system as still being registered.
#
# Minimum value: 0 (disables deregistration at shutdown)
# Maximum value: 1 (enables deregistration at shutdown)
shutdownDeregistration 1

# Registration interval -- Attempt to register the system on a periodic
# basis.  NOTE: Enabling this feature with a short interval on a large
# number of systems can result in unpredictable loads on the rBuilder.
# Specifies the interval in a number of days.
#
# Minimum value: 0 (disables periodic registration)
# Minimum interval: 1
# Maximum interval: 30 (days)
registrationInterval 1

# Contact timeout interval -- Attempt to register the system if rBuilder
# has not contacted the system within this time period.  Disabling this
# feature (without enabling registrationInterval) means that there is no
# way (short of restarting the system) to attempt to register with
# rBuilder should rBuilder lose contact with the system.
# Specifies the interval in a number of days.
#
# Minimum value: 0 (no timeout)
# Maximum value: 30 (days)
contactTimeoutInterval 3

# *** PARAMETERS CONTROLLING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS ***
#
# The following parameters define the way in which registration should be
# attempted:

# Registration port -- the IP port number to be used during registration
# attempts.
registrationPort 13579

# Registration methods -- A white space seperated list of ways to attempt an
# registration.  Each method listed is attempted, in sequence, until the
# registration succeeds, or all registration methods have been attempted.
#
# The supported registration methods are:
#
# "DIRECT" -- Attempt to register using a list of IP addresses and/or
# hostnames specifying the rBuilder and/or SPUTNIK(s)
#
# "SLP" -- Attempt to register by first using the Service Location
# Protocol to identify the IP address of an rBuilder or SPUTNIK,
# and then attempting to register with that IP address.
#
# Minimum value: "" (disables all registration activity)
# Maximum value: N/A
registrationMethod DIRECT 

# Direct method list -- A white space separated list of IP addresses and/or
# hostnames indicating the rBuilder and/or SPUTNIK(s)
# against which registration should be attempted.
# Hostnames can be specified with a port in the format of <hostname>:<port>.  If
# no port is specified, 443 is used.
#
# Minimum value: "" (disables all direct registration attempts)
# Maximum value: N/A
directMethod 

# SLP method list -- A white space separated list of SLP resources that should
# be queried to find the IP address of an rBuilder or SPUTNIK
# against which registration should be attempted.
#
# Note that the resource(s) listed here must agree with the resource(s)
# configured to be used by the relevant rBuilder(s) and/or SPUTNIK(s).
#
# Minimum value: "" (disables all SLP registration attempts)
# Maximum value: N/A
slpMethod rpath-inventory

# Registration retry count -- Once a specific entry is obtained from one
# of the registration method lists (direct or SLP), the number of times
# the registration client should attempt to register against that entry.
# Once this retry count has been reached, the registration client will
# move on the next entry (if one exists), the first entry in the next
# method (if one exists), or fails (if this was the last/only entry for
# the last/only registration method).
#
# Minimum value: 0 (Makes one registration attempt only; no retries)
# Maximum value: 10
registrationRetryCount 3

# Retry slot time -- The time (in seconds) used as part of the calculation
# to determine a randomized delay between registration attempts.  The
# maximum potential delay for retry #N is:
#
# MaxDelay = retrySlotTime * 2**N
#
# Minimum value: 15 (seconds)
# Maximum value: 900 (seconds)
retrySlotTime 15

# sfcb url -- The url to use to connect to the sfcb cim broker to querying
# system information.  Communication to the locally running sfcb can go over
# the unix socket.
#
# Minimum value: N/A
# Maximum value: N/A
sfcbUrl /tmp/sfcbHttpSocket

# debug mode -- Whether to enable debugging.  Extra debugging information is
# logged to the logfile and to stdout.
debugMode False

# *** PARAMETERS FOR FILE LOCATIONS FOR THE REGISTRATION PROCESS ***
# *** These do not need to be changed under normal circumstances ***
# The following parameters tell the registration client where to read/store
# files on the filesystem.

# top directory -- Directory used as the base for all other file locations.
topDir /etc/conary/rpath-tools

# generated uuid file -- File for the value of the generated uuid.
generatedUuidFile generated-uuid

# local uuid file -- File for the value of the local uuid read from dmi data.
localUuidFile local-uuid

# local uuid backup directory -- Directory to backup the contents of the old
# local uuid file in case the contents change.
localUuidBackupDirectoryName backup-local-uuid

# credentials directory name -- Directory for the sfcb credentials
credentialsDirectoryName credentials

# credentials certificate file name -- File for the public certificate for
# sfcb
credentialsCertFileName credentials.cert

# credentials key file name -- File for the private key for the sfcb
credentialsKeyFileName credentials.key

# sfcb configuration file -- File for the configuration file for sfcb
sfcbConfigurationFile /etc/conary/sfcb/sfcb.cfg

# last poll file -- File for the timestamp of when the last time that the system
# was polled by the rBA/Sputnik.  If the timestamp in this file is older than
# the current time - contactTimeoutInterval, the system will attempt an
# registration when the registration client is run.  If the --force parameter is
# specified, an registration will always be run.
lastPollFileName lastPoll

# log file -- File for logging all of the registration client's actions.
logFile /var/log/rpath-tools.log

# disable registration file -- File for indicating if the registration client
# should even attempt to register.  If the file exists (contents are ignored)
# the registration client will exit and not attempt an registration, irregardless
# of any other options (including --force).
disableRegistrationFileName disableRegistration

# last registration file -- File for storing the timestamp the last time that
# the system was registerd.
lastRegistrationFileName lastRegistration

# validate remote identity -- Boolean option to turn on or off validation of
# the identity of the remote registration server.  Validation occurs by
# verifying the SSL certificate offered by the registration server is signed by
# the CA certificate found under remoteCertificateAuthorityStore
validateRemoteIdentity True

# remote CA file path -- Directory for the CA cert of the remote registration server.
# The SSL cert offered by the remote server during registration will be verified
# that it is signed by this CA.
remoteCertificateAuthorityStore /etc/conary/rpath-tools/certs

# random wait file -- File storing the amount of seconds that will be waited
# when the daily cron job that runs rpath-tools runs.  A randomized value is
# created the first time --random-wait is passed to rpath-register and stored
# in this file.  This is so that there aren't a large number of systems
# running rpath-register at the same time.
randomWaitFileName randomWait

# random wait max -- The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that will be
# randomly waited when the --random-wait parameter is used.  The first time
# that a value for randomWait is generated, a random number greater than 0 and
# less than 1 is generated, then multiplied by randomWaitMax to get the value
# for randomWait
randomWaitMax 14440
